## Logo Prompt

```
A minimal, modern logo for "Velvet Arc" - an autonomous DeFi treasury agent. Design a sophisticated abstract mark combining:

- A soft curved arc shape suggesting protection and flow
- A subtle orbital ring or halo representing autonomous cycles
- Gradient colors from deep purple (#8B5CF6) through electric blue (#3B82F6) to emerald green (#10B981)
- Clean geometric lines with slight glow effects
- Dark background (#050505) with the logo mark illuminated
- No text, just the symbol/mark
- Style: minimalist fintech, premium crypto aesthetic, like a blend of Circle and Uniswap branding
- The mark should suggest: autonomy, protection, liquidity flow, and intelligent systems
- Think: glowing arc with a subtle pulse, orbital motion frozen in time

Style: vector-style, clean edges, subtle gradient glow, dark mode optimized, professional fintech logo
Aspect ratio: 1:1 (square)
```

### Alternative Logo Variations:

**Option A - Abstract Arc:**
```
Minimalist logo: A single elegant curved arc line with gradient from purple to cyan, with a small glowing orb at its peak. The arc suggests protection like a shield. Dark background #050505. Clean vector style, no text. Premium DeFi aesthetic.
```

**Option B - Orbital Ring:**
```
Modern crypto logo: An orbital ring with a velocity trail, colored in purple-to-blue gradient. Inside the ring, a subtle pulsing dot representing an autonomous agent. Dark background. Minimal, geometric, futuristic fintech style.
```

**Option C - Shield + Flow:**
```
Abstract fintech logo: A soft rounded shield shape with flowing curves inside suggesting liquidity movement. Gradient from emerald green through blue to purple. Subtle glow effect. Dark background. No text, icon only. Premium crypto branding.
```

## Cover Image Prompt

```
A wide cinematic cover image for "Velvet Arc" - an autonomous DeFi treasury management agent for ETHGlobal HackMoney 2026 hackathon submission.

Scene composition:
- Dark, atmospheric background with deep space-like depth (#050505 to #0a0a15)
- Central glowing orb/sphere representing the autonomous agent, with purple-blue-green gradient, soft pulsing light
- Multiple curved arc lines flowing around the orb like orbital paths or protective shields
- Subtle grid pattern in the background suggesting blockchain/technical precision
- Abstract representations of the 5 integrated technologies floating around:
  * Uniswap unicorn silhouette (pink glow)
  * Circle/USDC coin symbol (green glow)
  * Lightning bolt for Yellow Network (yellow/orange glow)
  * Bridge icon for LI.FI (purple glow)
  * ENS-style text bubble (blue glow)
- Flowing particle trails connecting all elements
- Text overlay space on the left side for title (leave dark area for text)
- Professional, premium fintech aesthetic
- Cinematic lighting with rim lights and volumetric glow

Style: Dark mode fintech hero image, ethereal crypto visualization, premium DeFi platform aesthetic, Dune/Blade Runner 2049 color grading
Aspect ratio: 16:9 or 1200x630 (social share dimensions)
Mood: Sophisticated, autonomous, protective, intelligent
```

### Alternative Cover Variations:

**Option A - Command Center:**
```
Wide cinematic image: A futuristic DeFi command center visualization. Central holographic display showing an autonomous agent orb with flowing data streams. Purple and blue lighting. Multiple chain logos subtly integrated as floating holograms. Dark atmospheric background with subtle grid. Professional hackathon cover aesthetic. 16:9 aspect ratio.
```

**Option B - Flow Visualization:**
```
Abstract DeFi cover image: Flowing liquidity streams in purple-blue-green gradients, converging into a central protected vault. Multiple orbital arcs suggesting cross-chain movement. Particle effects and subtle glow. Dark background with depth. Text space on left. Premium crypto platform visual. 1200x630 pixels.
```

**Option C - Agent Network:**
```
Cinematic tech cover: Network visualization with a central AI agent node connected to 5 protocol nodes (Uniswap, Circle, Yellow, LI.FI, ENS). Glowing connection lines with data particles. Deep purple-blue color scheme. Dark atmospheric background. Hackathon submission style. Professional and futuristic. 16:9 ratio.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **For Midjourney**: Add `--v 6 --ar 1:1` for logo, `--ar 16:9` for cover
2. **For DALL-E 3**: Be explicit about "no text" for logo
3. **For Leonardo**: Use "Cinematic" or "Unreal Engine" presets
4. **For Ideogram**: Good for text integration if you want "Velvet Arc" in the image

## Recommended Generators

- **Logo**: Midjourney (best for abstract marks), Leonardo AI
- **Cover**: Midjourney, DALL-E 3, Leonardo AI
- **Quick iterations**: Ideogram, Playground AI
