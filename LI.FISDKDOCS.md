# LI.FI SDK Overview

> Cross-chain and on-chain swap and bridging toolkit

## Introduction

LI.FI SDK provides a powerful toolkit for developers to enable seamless cross-chain and on-chain swaps and bridging within their applications. Our JavaScript/TypeScript SDK can be implemented in front-end or back-end environments, allowing you to build robust UX/UI around our advanced bridge and swap functionalities. LI.FI SDK efficiently manages all communications between our smart routing API and smart contracts and ensures optimal performance, security, and scalability for your cross-chain and on-chain needs.

**LI.FI SDK features include:**

* All ecosystems, chains, bridges, exchanges, and solvers that LI.FI supports
* Complete functionality covering full-cycle from obtaining routes/quotes to executing transactions
* Easy tracking of the route and quote execution through the robust event and hooks handling
* Highly customizable settings to tailor the SDK to your specific needs including configuration of RPCs and options to allow or deny certain chains, tokens, bridges, exchanges, solvers
* Supports widely adopted industry standards, including [EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702), [EIP-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792), [ERC-2612](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612), [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712), and [Permit2](https://github.com/Uniswap/permit2)
* SDK ecosystem providers are based on industry-standard libraries ([Viem](https://viem.sh/), [Wallet Standard](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard), [Bigmi](https://github.com/wallet-standard/wallet-standard))

# Configure SDK

> Get started and set up LI.FI SDK in just a few lines of code.

## Create Config

To get started, you need to create an initial configuration for the LI.FI SDK. This configuration contains the shared settings and data required for the proper functioning of other SDK features that developers will use. Additionally, the configuration can be updated later as needed.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { createConfig } from "@lifi/sdk";

createConfig({
  integrator: "Your dApp/company name",
});
```

## Parameters

| Parameter             | Required | Default                                      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

<Tip>
  To learn how to use `routeOptions` for monetization, including configuring
  fees, see the [Monetize the SDK](/sdk/monetize-sdk) guide.
</Tip>

<Note>
  Setting up providers is not required if you are using the SDK solely to access
  the LI.FI API without quote/route SDK execution functionality and plan to
  handle the execution independently.
</Note>

## Setting custom RPC URLs

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { createConfig, ChainId } from "@lifi/sdk";

createConfig({
  integrator: "Your dApp/company name",
  rpcUrls: {
    [ChainId.ARB]: ["https://arbitrum-example.node.com/"],
    [ChainId.SOL]: ["https://solana-example.node.com/"],
  },
});
```

<Warning>
  In a production app, it is recommended to pass through your authenticated RPC provider URL (Alchemy, Infura, Ankr, etc).

  If no RPC URLs are provided, LI.FI SDK will default to public RPC providers.

  Public RPC endpoints (especially Solana) can sometimes rate-limit users depending on location or during periods of heavy load, leading to issues such as incorrectly displaying balances or errors with transaction simulation.
</Warning>

## Update SDK configuration

LI.FI SDK provides various methods to manage and manipulate the SDK settings dynamically. To update the configuration, you need to import the global configuration object and use its methods.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { config } from "@lifi/sdk";
```

After creating your configuration with the `createConfig` function, `config` acts as a global configuration object.

## Configuration Methods

| Method                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get()`                                  | Returns the current SDK configuration.                                                                                                                                             |
| `set(options: SDKConfig)`                | Sets the SDK configuration with the provided options.                                                                                                                              |
| `setProviders(providers: SDKProvider[])` | Sets the providers in the SDK configuration. If a provider already exists, it will be updated with the new information.                                                            |
| `getChains()`                            | Returns a promise that resolves to the list of configured chains. If the configuration is still loading, the promise will wait until the loading is complete.                      |
| `setChains(chains: ExtendedChain[])`     | Sets the chains in the SDK configuration and updates chains RPC URLs. This method also clears the loading state.                                                                   |
| `getChainById(chainId: ChainId)`         | Returns a promise that resolves to the chain configuration for the specified chain ID. If the configuration is still loading, the promise will wait until the loading is complete. |
| `getRPCUrls()`                           | Returns a promise that resolves to the list of RPC URLs for the configured chains. If the configuration is still loading, the promise will wait until the loading is complete.     |
| `setRPCUrls(rpcUrls: RPCUrls)`           | Sets the RPC URLs for the chains in the SDK configuration. If some RPC URLs already exist for a chain, the new URLs will be appended to the existing ones.                         |

# Multi-VM Support

> Seamlessly connecting every ecosystem for your needs

## Introduction to SDK Ecosystem Providers

The LI.FI SDK supports different blockchain ecosystems, allowing you to integrate with EVM and Solana networks, with more ecosystems on the way. Internally, providers act as abstractions for each ecosystem, handling crucial tasks such as address resolution,  balance checking, and transaction handling during route/quote execution.

These ecosystem providers are designed with modularity in mind and are fully tree-shakable, ensuring that they do not add unnecessary weight to your bundle if not used.

The SDK offers four providers, `EVM`, `Solana`, `UTXO` and `Sui`, each with similar configuration options respective to their ecosystems.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { EVM, Solana, Sui, UTXO } from '@lifi/sdk'
```

The setup for all providers focuses on utilizing a wallet client, wallet adapter, or a similar wallet interface concept depending on the ecosystem-specific libraries and standards. This unified approach simplifies managing wallets and transactions across EVM-compatible, Solana, and Sui chains.

### Different types of wallets/accounts

To execute `GET /quote` or `POST /advanced/routes` via a specific provider, that provider must be capable of signing transactions. SDK providers support signing transactions over the following types of wallets/accounts:

* **Local Accounts (e.g. private key/mnemonic wallets).**

Local accounts are wallets managed using private keys or mnemonic phrases. This setup is often used in backend services or scenarios where automated signing and transaction management are required.

* **JSON-RPC Accounts (e.g. Browser Extension Wallets, WalletConnect, etc.).**

Using JSON-RPC accounts involves connecting through a Web3 provider, e.g. `window.ethereum`, and managing the user's account within the browser or mobile context. This setup is popular among dApps UIs and is often used together with libraries like `Wagmi`, `@solana/web3.js`, or `@mysten/dapp-kit`.

These account types and interaction methods allow developers to choose the most suitable approach for integrating the SDK with their applications.

## Setup EVM Provider

The EVM provider execution logic is built based on the `Viem` library, using some of its types and terminology.

**Options available for configuring the EVM provider:**

* `getWalletClient`: A function that returns a `WalletClient` instance.

* `switchChain`: A hook for switching between different networks.

### Local Accounts

When using local accounts, developers need a predefined list of chains they plan to interact with in order to switch chains during transaction execution. These chains can be either from the `viem/chains` package or fetched from LI.FI API and adopted to viem's `Chain` type.

Here's a basic example using chains from `viem/chains`:

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { createConfig, EVM } from '@lifi/sdk'
import type { Chain } from 'viem'
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
import { arbitrum, mainnet, optimism, polygon, scroll } from 'viem/chains'

const account = privateKeyToAccount('PRIVATE_KEY')

const chains = [arbitrum, mainnet, optimism, polygon, scroll]

const client = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
})

createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  providers: [
    EVM({
      getWalletClient: async () => client,
      switchChain: async (chainId) =>
        // Switch chain by creating a new wallet client
        createWalletClient({
          account,
          chain: chains.find((chain) => chain.id == chainId) as Chain,
          transport: http(),
        }),
    }),
  ],
})
```

### JSON-RPC Accounts

The best way to interact with JSON-RPC accounts and pass `WalletClient` to the `EVM` provider is to use the [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) library. Developers can configure Wagmi chains either by using chains from the `viem/chains` package or fetching chains from LI.FI API and adapting them to Viem's `Chain` type.

Below is a simplified example of how to set up the EVM provider using chains from the LI.FI API in conjunction with Wagmi and React.

We provide a `useSyncWagmiConfig` hook that synchronizes fetched chains with the Wagmi configuration and updates connectors. Please note that we do not initialize the Wagmi configuration with connectors. Additionally, we set `reconnectOnMount` to `false` since the `reconnect` action will be called within `useSyncWagmiConfig` hook after the chains are synchronized with the configuration and connectors.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { ChainType, EVM, config, createConfig, getChains } from '@lifi/sdk';
import { useSyncWagmiConfig } from '@lifi/wallet-management';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { getWalletClient, switchChain } from '@wagmi/core';
import { type FC, type PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
import { createClient, http } from 'viem';
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains';
import type { Config, CreateConnectorFn } from 'wagmi';
import { WagmiProvider, createConfig as createWagmiConfig } from 'wagmi';
import { injected } from 'wagmi/connectors';

// List of Wagmi connectors
const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = [injected()];

// Create Wagmi config with default chain and without connectors
const wagmiConfig: Config = createWagmiConfig({
  chains: [mainnet],
  client({ chain }) {
    return createClient({ chain, transport: http() });
  },
});

// Create SDK config using Wagmi actions and configuration
const config = createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  providers: [
    EVM({
      getWalletClient: () => getWalletClient(wagmiConfig),
      switchChain: async (chainId) => {
        const chain = await switchChain(wagmiConfig, { chainId });
        return getWalletClient(wagmiConfig, { chainId: chain.id });
      },
    }),
  ],
  // We disable chain preloading and will update chain configuration in runtime
  preloadChains: false,
});

export const CustomWagmiProvider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  // Load EVM chains from LI.FI API using getChains action from LI.FI SDK
  const { data: chains } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['chains'] as const,
    queryFn: async () => {
      const chains = await getChains({
        chainTypes: [ChainType.EVM],
      });
      // Update chain configuration for LI.FI SDK
      config.setChains(chains);
      return chains;
    },
  });

  // Synchronize fetched chains with Wagmi config and update connectors
  useSyncWagmiConfig(wagmiConfig, connectors, chains);

  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={wagmiConfig} reconnectOnMount={false}>
      {children}
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
};

```

### Update provider configuration

Additionally, providers allow for dynamic updates to its initial configuration via the `setOptions` function.

Here's an example of how to modify the initial configuration for `EVM` provider:

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { createConfig, EVM } from '@lifi/sdk'
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
import { arbitrum, mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const account = privateKeyToAccount('PRIVATE_KEY')

const mainnetClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
})

const evmProvider = EVM({
  getWalletClient: async () => mainnetClient,
})

createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  providers: [evmProvider],
})

const optimismClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: arbitrum,
  transport: http(),
})

evmProvider.setOptions({
  getWalletClient: async () => optimismClient,
})
```

### Support for Ethers.js and other alternatives

Developers can still use Ethers.js or any other alternative Web3 library in their project and [convert](https://viem.sh/docs/ethers-migration) `Signer`/`Provider` objects to Viem's `WalletClient` before passing it to the EVM provider configuration.

## Setup Solana Provider

The Solana provider execution logic is built based on the [@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) and [@solana/wallet-adapter-base](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) libraries, using some of its types and terminology.

**Options available for configuring the EVM provider:**

* `getWalletAdapter`: A function that returns a WalletAdapter instance.

### Local Wallet Adapter

Standard Solana libraries do not offer a built-in method for creating a wallet adapter directly from a private key. To address this limitation, we provide the `KeypairWalletAdapter`. This custom adapter enables users to create a wallet adapter from a private key.

It is worth noting that the `KeypairWalletAdapter` is designed specifically for backend or testing purposes and should not be used in user-facing code to prevent the risk of exposing your private key.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { createConfig, KeypairWalletAdapter, Solana } from '@lifi/sdk'

const walletAdapter = new KeypairWalletAdapter('PRIVATE_KEY')

createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  providers: [
    Solana({
      getWalletAdapter: async () => walletAdapter,
    }),
  ],
})
```

### JSON-RPC Wallet Adapter

To interact with JSON-RPC accounts and pass `WalletAdapter` to the Solana provider, we recommend using the [@solana/wallet-adapter-base](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) and [@solana/wallet-adapter-react](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) libraries. Unlike Wagmi, Solana configuration for React does not have global configurations. Therefore, we need to use React hooks to update the SDK configuration at runtime.

Below is a simplified example of how to set up the Solana provider.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript SDKProviders.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { Solana, config, createConfig } from '@lifi/sdk';
  import type { SignerWalletAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';
  import { useWallet } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';
  import { useEffect } from 'react';

  createConfig({
    integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  });

  export const SDKProviders = () => {
    const { wallet } = useWallet();

    useEffect(() => {
      // Configure SDK Providers
      config.setProviders([
        Solana({
          async getWalletAdapter() {
            return wallet?.adapter as SignerWalletAdapter;
          },
        }),
      ]);
    }, [wallet?.adapter]);

    return null;
  };
  ```

  ```typescript SolanaProvider.tsx theme={"system"}
  import type { Adapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';
  import { WalletAdapterNetwork } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';
  import {
    ConnectionProvider,
    WalletProvider,
  } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';
  import { clusterApiUrl } from '@solana/web3.js';
  import { type FC, type PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
  import { SDKProviders } from './SDKProviders.js';

  const endpoint = clusterApiUrl(WalletAdapterNetwork.Mainnet);
  /**
   * Wallets that implement either of these standards will be available automatically.
   *
   *   - Solana Mobile Stack Mobile Wallet Adapter Protocol
   *     (https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter)
   *   - Solana Wallet Standard
   *     (https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-standard)
   *
   * If you wish to support a wallet that supports neither of those standards,
   * instantiate its legacy wallet adapter here. Common legacy adapters can be found
   * in the npm package `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`.
   */
  const wallets: Adapter[] = [];

  export const SVMBaseProvider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
        <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
          {/* Configure Solana SDK provider */}
          <SDKProviders />
          {children}
        </WalletProvider>
      </ConnectionProvider>
    );
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup Sui Provider

The Sui provider execution logic is built based on the [@mysten/dapp-kit](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) and [@mysten/sui](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript) libraries, using some of its types and terminology.

**Options available for configuring the Sui provider:**

* `getWallet`: A function that returns a `WalletWithRequiredFeatures` instance (defined by `@mysten/wallet-standard`).

### JSON-RPC Wallet

To interact with user wallets (like Sui Wallet, Ethos, etc.) and pass `WalletWithRequiredFeatures` to the Sui provider, we recommend using the [@mysten/dapp-kit](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) library.

Below is a simplified example of how to set up the Sui provider with user wallets.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript SDKProviders.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { Sui, config, createConfig } from '@lifi/sdk';
  import { useCurrentWallet } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
  import { useEffect } from 'react';

  createConfig({
    integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  });

  export const SDKProviders = () => {
    const { currentWallet } = useCurrentWallet();

    useEffect(() => {
      // Configure Sui SDK provider
      config.setProviders([
        Sui({
          async getWallet() {
            return currentWallet!;
          },
        }),
      ]);
    }, [currentWallet]);

    return null;
  };
  ```

  ```typescript SuiProvider.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { SuiClientProvider, WalletProvider } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
  import { getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui/client';
  import { type FC, type PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
  import { SDKProviders } from './SDKProviders.js';

  const { networkConfig } = createNetworkConfig({
  	mainnet: { url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet') },
  });

  export const SuiBaseProvider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <SuiClientProvider networks={networkConfig} defaultNetwork="mainnet">
        <WalletProvider autoConnect>
          {/* Configure Sui SDK provider */}
          <SDKProviders />
          {children}
        </WalletProvider>
      </SuiClientProvider>
    );
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup UTXO (Bitcoin) Provider

The Bitcoin provider execution logic is built based on the [Bigmi](https://github.com/lifinance/bigmi) library, using some of its types and terminology.

**Options available for configuring the UTXO provider:**

* `getWalletClient`: A function that returns a `Client` instance

### JSON-RPC Wallet

To interact with user wallets like Phantom, Xverse, use the `getConnectorClient` action to return the Bigmi Client object required by the SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript SDKProvider.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { createConfig, UTXO } from '@lifi/sdk'
  import { getConnectorClient } from '@bigmi/client' 
  import { useConfig } from '@bigmi/react'


  const config = createConfig({
    integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  })

  export const SDKProviders = () => {
    const bigmiConfig = useConfig();

    useEffect(() => {
      // Configure SDK Provider
      config.setProviders([
        UTXO({
          async getWalletClient() {
            return getConnectorClient(bigmiConfig)
          },
        }),
      ]);
    }, [bigmiConfig]);

    return null;
  };

  ```

  ```typescript UTXOProvider.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { bitcoin, createClient, http } from '@bigmi/core'
  import { createConfig, phantom, getConnectorClient, type CreateConnectorFn, type Config } from '@bigmi/client' 
  import { BigmiProvider } from '@bigmi/react'
  import { SDKProvider } from './SDKProvider.js'

    const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = [phantom()]

    const bigmiConfig = createConfig({
      chains: [bitcoin],
      connectors,
      client({ chain }) {
        return createClient({ chain, transport: http() })
      }
    }) as Config

  export const UTXOProvider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <BigmiProvider config={bigmiConfig} reconnectOnMount>
      <SDKProvider />
        { children }
      </BigmiProvider>
    )
  }

  ```

# Multi-VM Support

> Seamlessly connecting every ecosystem for your needs

## Introduction to SDK Ecosystem Providers

The LI.FI SDK supports different blockchain ecosystems, allowing you to integrate with EVM and Solana networks, with more ecosystems on the way. Internally, providers act as abstractions for each ecosystem, handling crucial tasks such as address resolution,  balance checking, and transaction handling during route/quote execution.

These ecosystem providers are designed with modularity in mind and are fully tree-shakable, ensuring that they do not add unnecessary weight to your bundle if not used.

The SDK offers four providers, `EVM`, `Solana`, `UTXO` and `Sui`, each with similar configuration options respective to their ecosystems.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { EVM, Solana, Sui, UTXO } from '@lifi/sdk'
```

The setup for all providers focuses on utilizing a wallet client, wallet adapter, or a similar wallet interface concept depending on the ecosystem-specific libraries and standards. This unified approach simplifies managing wallets and transactions across EVM-compatible, Solana, and Sui chains.

### Different types of wallets/accounts

To execute `GET /quote` or `POST /advanced/routes` via a specific provider, that provider must be capable of signing transactions. SDK providers support signing transactions over the following types of wallets/accounts:

* **Local Accounts (e.g. private key/mnemonic wallets).**

Local accounts are wallets managed using private keys or mnemonic phrases. This setup is often used in backend services or scenarios where automated signing and transaction management are required.

* **JSON-RPC Accounts (e.g. Browser Extension Wallets, WalletConnect, etc.).**

Using JSON-RPC accounts involves connecting through a Web3 provider, e.g. `window.ethereum`, and managing the user's account within the browser or mobile context. This setup is popular among dApps UIs and is often used together with libraries like `Wagmi`, `@solana/web3.js`, or `@mysten/dapp-kit`.

These account types and interaction methods allow developers to choose the most suitable approach for integrating the SDK with their applications.

## Setup EVM Provider

The EVM provider execution logic is built based on the `Viem` library, using some of its types and terminology.

**Options available for configuring the EVM provider:**

* `getWalletClient`: A function that returns a `WalletClient` instance.

* `switchChain`: A hook for switching between different networks.

### Local Accounts

When using local accounts, developers need a predefined list of chains they plan to interact with in order to switch chains during transaction execution. These chains can be either from the `viem/chains` package or fetched from LI.FI API and adopted to viem's `Chain` type.

Here's a basic example using chains from `viem/chains`:

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { createConfig, EVM } from '@lifi/sdk'
import type { Chain } from 'viem'
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
import { arbitrum, mainnet, optimism, polygon, scroll } from 'viem/chains'

const account = privateKeyToAccount('PRIVATE_KEY')

const chains = [arbitrum, mainnet, optimism, polygon, scroll]

const client = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
})

createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  providers: [
    EVM({
      getWalletClient: async () => client,
      switchChain: async (chainId) =>
        // Switch chain by creating a new wallet client
        createWalletClient({
          account,
          chain: chains.find((chain) => chain.id == chainId) as Chain,
          transport: http(),
        }),
    }),
  ],
})
```

### JSON-RPC Accounts

The best way to interact with JSON-RPC accounts and pass `WalletClient` to the `EVM` provider is to use the [Wagmi](https://wagmi.sh/) library. Developers can configure Wagmi chains either by using chains from the `viem/chains` package or fetching chains from LI.FI API and adapting them to Viem's `Chain` type.

Below is a simplified example of how to set up the EVM provider using chains from the LI.FI API in conjunction with Wagmi and React.

We provide a `useSyncWagmiConfig` hook that synchronizes fetched chains with the Wagmi configuration and updates connectors. Please note that we do not initialize the Wagmi configuration with connectors. Additionally, we set `reconnectOnMount` to `false` since the `reconnect` action will be called within `useSyncWagmiConfig` hook after the chains are synchronized with the configuration and connectors.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { ChainType, EVM, config, createConfig, getChains } from '@lifi/sdk';
import { useSyncWagmiConfig } from '@lifi/wallet-management';
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { getWalletClient, switchChain } from '@wagmi/core';
import { type FC, type PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
import { createClient, http } from 'viem';
import { mainnet } from 'viem/chains';
import type { Config, CreateConnectorFn } from 'wagmi';
import { WagmiProvider, createConfig as createWagmiConfig } from 'wagmi';
import { injected } from 'wagmi/connectors';

// List of Wagmi connectors
const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = [injected()];

// Create Wagmi config with default chain and without connectors
const wagmiConfig: Config = createWagmiConfig({
  chains: [mainnet],
  client({ chain }) {
    return createClient({ chain, transport: http() });
  },
});

// Create SDK config using Wagmi actions and configuration
const config = createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  providers: [
    EVM({
      getWalletClient: () => getWalletClient(wagmiConfig),
      switchChain: async (chainId) => {
        const chain = await switchChain(wagmiConfig, { chainId });
        return getWalletClient(wagmiConfig, { chainId: chain.id });
      },
    }),
  ],
  // We disable chain preloading and will update chain configuration in runtime
  preloadChains: false,
});

export const CustomWagmiProvider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
  // Load EVM chains from LI.FI API using getChains action from LI.FI SDK
  const { data: chains } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['chains'] as const,
    queryFn: async () => {
      const chains = await getChains({
        chainTypes: [ChainType.EVM],
      });
      // Update chain configuration for LI.FI SDK
      config.setChains(chains);
      return chains;
    },
  });

  // Synchronize fetched chains with Wagmi config and update connectors
  useSyncWagmiConfig(wagmiConfig, connectors, chains);

  return (
    <WagmiProvider config={wagmiConfig} reconnectOnMount={false}>
      {children}
    </WagmiProvider>
  );
};

```

### Update provider configuration

Additionally, providers allow for dynamic updates to its initial configuration via the `setOptions` function.

Here's an example of how to modify the initial configuration for `EVM` provider:

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { createConfig, EVM } from '@lifi/sdk'
import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'
import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts'
import { arbitrum, mainnet } from 'viem/chains'

const account = privateKeyToAccount('PRIVATE_KEY')

const mainnetClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: mainnet,
  transport: http(),
})

const evmProvider = EVM({
  getWalletClient: async () => mainnetClient,
})

createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  providers: [evmProvider],
})

const optimismClient = createWalletClient({
  account,
  chain: arbitrum,
  transport: http(),
})

evmProvider.setOptions({
  getWalletClient: async () => optimismClient,
})
```

### Support for Ethers.js and other alternatives

Developers can still use Ethers.js or any other alternative Web3 library in their project and [convert](https://viem.sh/docs/ethers-migration) `Signer`/`Provider` objects to Viem's `WalletClient` before passing it to the EVM provider configuration.

## Setup Solana Provider

The Solana provider execution logic is built based on the [@solana/web3.js](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/) and [@solana/wallet-adapter-base](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) libraries, using some of its types and terminology.

**Options available for configuring the EVM provider:**

* `getWalletAdapter`: A function that returns a WalletAdapter instance.

### Local Wallet Adapter

Standard Solana libraries do not offer a built-in method for creating a wallet adapter directly from a private key. To address this limitation, we provide the `KeypairWalletAdapter`. This custom adapter enables users to create a wallet adapter from a private key.

It is worth noting that the `KeypairWalletAdapter` is designed specifically for backend or testing purposes and should not be used in user-facing code to prevent the risk of exposing your private key.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { createConfig, KeypairWalletAdapter, Solana } from '@lifi/sdk'

const walletAdapter = new KeypairWalletAdapter('PRIVATE_KEY')

createConfig({
  integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  providers: [
    Solana({
      getWalletAdapter: async () => walletAdapter,
    }),
  ],
})
```

### JSON-RPC Wallet Adapter

To interact with JSON-RPC accounts and pass `WalletAdapter` to the Solana provider, we recommend using the [@solana/wallet-adapter-base](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) and [@solana/wallet-adapter-react](https://github.com/anza-xyz/wallet-adapter) libraries. Unlike Wagmi, Solana configuration for React does not have global configurations. Therefore, we need to use React hooks to update the SDK configuration at runtime.

Below is a simplified example of how to set up the Solana provider.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript SDKProviders.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { Solana, config, createConfig } from '@lifi/sdk';
  import type { SignerWalletAdapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';
  import { useWallet } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';
  import { useEffect } from 'react';

  createConfig({
    integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  });

  export const SDKProviders = () => {
    const { wallet } = useWallet();

    useEffect(() => {
      // Configure SDK Providers
      config.setProviders([
        Solana({
          async getWalletAdapter() {
            return wallet?.adapter as SignerWalletAdapter;
          },
        }),
      ]);
    }, [wallet?.adapter]);

    return null;
  };
  ```

  ```typescript SolanaProvider.tsx theme={"system"}
  import type { Adapter } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';
  import { WalletAdapterNetwork } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-base';
  import {
    ConnectionProvider,
    WalletProvider,
  } from '@solana/wallet-adapter-react';
  import { clusterApiUrl } from '@solana/web3.js';
  import { type FC, type PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
  import { SDKProviders } from './SDKProviders.js';

  const endpoint = clusterApiUrl(WalletAdapterNetwork.Mainnet);
  /**
   * Wallets that implement either of these standards will be available automatically.
   *
   *   - Solana Mobile Stack Mobile Wallet Adapter Protocol
   *     (https://github.com/solana-mobile/mobile-wallet-adapter)
   *   - Solana Wallet Standard
   *     (https://github.com/solana-labs/wallet-standard)
   *
   * If you wish to support a wallet that supports neither of those standards,
   * instantiate its legacy wallet adapter here. Common legacy adapters can be found
   * in the npm package `@solana/wallet-adapter-wallets`.
   */
  const wallets: Adapter[] = [];

  export const SVMBaseProvider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <ConnectionProvider endpoint={endpoint}>
        <WalletProvider wallets={wallets} autoConnect>
          {/* Configure Solana SDK provider */}
          <SDKProviders />
          {children}
        </WalletProvider>
      </ConnectionProvider>
    );
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Setup Sui Provider

The Sui provider execution logic is built based on the [@mysten/dapp-kit](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) and [@mysten/sui](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/typescript) libraries, using some of its types and terminology.

**Options available for configuring the Sui provider:**

* `getWallet`: A function that returns a `WalletWithRequiredFeatures` instance (defined by `@mysten/wallet-standard`).

### JSON-RPC Wallet

To interact with user wallets (like Sui Wallet, Ethos, etc.) and pass `WalletWithRequiredFeatures` to the Sui provider, we recommend using the [@mysten/dapp-kit](https://sdk.mystenlabs.com/dapp-kit) library.

Below is a simplified example of how to set up the Sui provider with user wallets.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript SDKProviders.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { Sui, config, createConfig } from '@lifi/sdk';
  import { useCurrentWallet } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
  import { useEffect } from 'react';

  createConfig({
    integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  });

  export const SDKProviders = () => {
    const { currentWallet } = useCurrentWallet();

    useEffect(() => {
      // Configure Sui SDK provider
      config.setProviders([
        Sui({
          async getWallet() {
            return currentWallet!;
          },
        }),
      ]);
    }, [currentWallet]);

    return null;
  };
  ```

  ```typescript SuiProvider.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { SuiClientProvider, WalletProvider } from '@mysten/dapp-kit';
  import { getFullnodeUrl } from '@mysten/sui/client';
  import { type FC, type PropsWithChildren } from 'react';
  import { SDKProviders } from './SDKProviders.js';

  const { networkConfig } = createNetworkConfig({
  	mainnet: { url: getFullnodeUrl('mainnet') },
  });

  export const SuiBaseProvider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <SuiClientProvider networks={networkConfig} defaultNetwork="mainnet">
        <WalletProvider autoConnect>

## Setup UTXO (Bitcoin) Provider

The Bitcoin provider execution logic is built based on the [Bigmi](https://github.com/lifinance/bigmi) library, using some of its types and terminology.

**Options available for configuring the UTXO provider:**

* `getWalletClient`: A function that returns a `Client` instance

### JSON-RPC Wallet

To interact with user wallets like Phantom, Xverse, use the `getConnectorClient` action to return the Bigmi Client object required by the SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript SDKProvider.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { createConfig, UTXO } from '@lifi/sdk'
  import { getConnectorClient } from '@bigmi/client' 
  import { useConfig } from '@bigmi/react'


  const config = createConfig({
    integrator: 'Your dApp/company name',
  })

  export const SDKProviders = () => {
    const bigmiConfig = useConfig();

    useEffect(() => {
      // Configure SDK Provider
      config.setProviders([
        UTXO({
          async getWalletClient() {
            return getConnectorClient(bigmiConfig)
          },
        }),
      ]);
    }, [bigmiConfig]);

    return null;
  };

  ```

  ```typescript UTXOProvider.tsx theme={"system"}
  import { bitcoin, createClient, http } from '@bigmi/core'
  import { createConfig, phantom, getConnectorClient, type CreateConnectorFn, type Config } from '@bigmi/client' 
  import { BigmiProvider } from '@bigmi/react'
  import { SDKProvider } from './SDKProvider.js'

    const connectors: CreateConnectorFn[] = [phantom()]

    const bigmiConfig = createConfig({
      chains: [bitcoin],
      connectors,
      client({ chain }) {
        return createClient({ chain, transport: http() })
      }
    }) as Config

  export const UTXOProvider: FC<PropsWithChildren> = ({ children }) => {
    return (
      <BigmiProvider config={bigmiConfig} reconnectOnMount>
      <SDKProvider />
        { children }
      </BigmiProvider>
    )
  }

  ```

# Request Routes/Quotes

> Prior to executing any swap or bridging, you need to request the best route from our smart routing API..

The LI.FI SDK provides functionality to request routes and quotes, as well as to execute them. This guide will walk you through the process of making a request using `getRoutes` and `getQuote` functions.

## How to request Routes

To get started, here is a simple example of how to request routes to bridge and swap 10 USDC on Arbitrum to the maximum amount of DAI on Optimism.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { getRoutes } from '@lifi/sdk';

const routesRequest: RoutesRequest = {
  fromChainId: 42161, // Arbitrum
  toChainId: 10, // Optimism
  fromTokenAddress: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on Arbitrum
  toTokenAddress: '0xDA10009cBd5D07dd0CeCc66161FC93D7c9000da1', // DAI on Optimism
  fromAmount: '10000000', // 10 USDC
};

const result = await getRoutes(routesRequest);
const routes = result.routes;
```

When you request routes, you receive an array of route objects containing the essential information to determine which route to take for a swap or bridging transfer. At this stage, transaction data is not included and must be requested separately. Read more [Execute Routes/Quotes](/sdk/execute-routes).

Additionally, if you would like to receive just one best option that our smart routing API can offer, it might be better to request a quote using `getQuote`.

## Routes request parameters

The `getRoutes` function expects a `RoutesRequest` object, which specifies a desired *any-to-any* transfer and includes all the information needed to calculate the most efficient routes.

### Parameters

Below are the parameters for the `RoutesRequest` interface along with their descriptions:

## Allow/Deny/Prefer

The `AllowDenyPrefer` interface is used to specify preferences for bridges or exchanges. Using the `allow` option, you can allow tools, and only those tools will be used to find the best routes. Tools specified in `deny` will be blocklisted.

You can find all available keys in [List: Chains, Bridges, DEX Aggregators, Solvers](https://docs.li.fi/list-chains-bridges-dex-aggregators-solvers) or get the available option from the API. See [Chains and Tools](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/chains-and-tools).

Below are the parameters for the `AllowDenyPrefer` interface:

| Parameter | Type      | Required | Description                                                                               |

| `allow`   | string\[] | no       | A list of allowed bridges or exchanges (default: all).                                    |
| `deny`    | string\[] | no       | A list of denied bridges or exchanges (default: none).                                    |
| `prefer`  | string\[] | no       | A list of preferred bridges or exchanges (e.g., \['1inch'] to prefer 1inch if available). |

## Timing

The `Timing` interface allows you to specify preferences for the timing of route execution. This can help optimize the performance of your requests based on timing strategies.

Parameters for the `Timing` interface:

| Parameter                  | Type              | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `swapStepTimingStrategies` | TimingStrategy\[] | no       | An array of timing strategies specifically for each swap step in the route. This allows you to define custom strategies for timing control during the execution of individual swap steps.       |
| `routeTimingStrategies`    | TimingStrategy\[] | no       | An array of timing strategies that apply to the entire route. This enables you to set preferences for how routes are timed overall, potentially improving execution efficiency and reliability. |

## Timing Strategy

This can help optimize the timing of requests based on specific conditions.

| Parameter                 | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| `strategy`                | string |          | The strategy type, which must be set to 'minWaitTime'. This indicates that the timing strategy being applied is based on a minimum wait time.                                                        |
| `minWaitTimeMs`           | number |          | The minimum wait time in milliseconds before any results are returned. This value ensures that the request waits for a specified duration to allow for more accurate results.                        |
| `startingExpectedResults` | number |          | The initial number of expected results that should be returned after the minimum wait time has elapsed. This helps in managing user expectations regarding the outcomes of the request.              |
| `reduceEveryMs`           | number |          | The interval in milliseconds at which the expected results are reduced as the wait time progresses. This parameter allows for dynamic adjustments to the expected results based on the elapsed time. |

<Note>
  You can implement [custom timing strategies](https://docs.li.fi/li.fi-api/li.fi-api/requesting-a-quote/optimizing-quote-response-timing) to improve the user experience and optimize the performance of your application by controlling the timing of route execution.
</Note>

## Request a Quote

When you request a quote, our smart routing API provides the best available option. The quote includes all necessary information and transaction data required to initiate a swap or bridging transfer.

Here is a simple example of how to request a quote to bridge and swap 10 USDC on Arbitrum to the maximum amount of DAI on Optimism.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { getQuote } from '@lifi/sdk';

const quoteRequest: QuoteRequest = {
  fromChain: 42161, // Arbitrum
  toChain: 10, // Optimism
  fromToken: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on Arbitrum
  toToken: '0xDA10009cBd5D07dd0CeCc66161FC93D7c9000da1', // DAI on Optimism
  fromAmount: '10000000', // 10 USDC
  // The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
  fromAddress: '0x552008c0f6870c2f77e5cC1d2eb9bdff03e30Ea0', 
};

const quote = await getQuote(quoteRequest);
```

## Quote request parameters

The `getQuotes` function expects a `QuoteRequest` object. `RoutesRequest` and `QuoteRequest` have some similarities and slight differences, and below, you can find a description of the `QuoteRequest` interface's parameters.

| Parameter          | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `fromChain`        | number | yes      | The ID of the source chain (e.g., Ethereum mainnet is 1).                                                                                        |
| `fromToken`        | string | yes      | The contract address of the token on the source chain. Ensure this address corresponds to the specified `fromChain`.                             |
| `fromAmount`       | string | yes      | The amount to be transferred from the source chain, specified in the smallest unit of the token (e.g., wei for ETH).                             |
| `fromAddress`      | string | yes      | The address from which the tokens are being transferred.                                                                                         |
| `toChain`          | number | yes      | The ID of the destination chain (e.g., Optimism is 10).                                                                                          |
| `toToken`          | string | yes      | The contract address of the token on the destination chain. Ensure this address corresponds to the specified `toChain`.                          |
| `toAddress`        | string | no       | The address to which the tokens will be sent on the destination chain once the transaction is completed.                                         |
| `fromAmountForGas` | string | no       | Part of the LI.Fuel. Allows receiving a part of the bridged tokens as gas on the destination chain. Specified in the smallest unit of the token. |

### Other Quote parameters

In addition to the parameters mentioned above, all parameters listed in the [Route Options](##route-options) section are also available when using `getQuote`, except for `allowSwitchChain`, which is used exclusively to control chain switching in route requests.

Also, parameters to specify options for allowing, denying, or preferring certain bridges and exchanges have slightly different names:

* `allowBridges` (string\[], optional)

* `denyBridges` (string\[], optional)

* `preferBridges` (string\[], optional)

* `allowExchanges` (string\[], optional)

* `denyExchanges` (string\[], optional)

* `preferExchanges` (string\[], optional)

Additionally, you can specify [timing strategies](https://docs.li.fi/li.fi-api/li.fi-api/requesting-a-quote/optimizing-quote-response-timing#parameters-overview) for the swap steps using the `swapStepTimingStrategies` parameter:

* **`swapStepTimingStrategies`** (string\[], optional) Specifies the timing strategy for swap steps. This parameter allows you to define how long the request should wait for results and manage expected outcomes. The format is:

```typescript  theme={"system"}
minWaitTime-${minWaitTimeMs}-${startingExpectedResults}-${reduceEveryMs}
```

## Request contract call Quote

Besides requesting general quotes, the LI.FI SDK also provides functionality to request quotes for destination contract calls.

Read more [Composer](/introduction/user-flows-and-examples/lifi-composer).

Here is a simple example of how to request a quote to bridge and purchase an NFT on the OpenSea marketplace costing 0.0000085 ETH on the Base chain using ETH from Optimism. The call data for this example was obtained using the OpenSea Seaport SDK.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { getContractCallsQuote } from '@lifi/sdk';

const contractCallsQuoteRequest = {
  fromAddress: '0x552008c0f6870c2f77e5cC1d2eb9bdff03e30Ea0',
  fromChain: 10,
  fromToken: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  toAmount: '8500000000000',
  toChain: 8453,
  toToken: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
  contractCalls: [
    {
      fromAmount: '8500000000000',
      fromTokenAddress: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
      toContractAddress: '0x0000000000000068F116a894984e2DB1123eB395',
      toContractCallData:
        '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',
      toContractGasLimit: '210000',
    },
  ],
};

const contractCallQuote = await getContractCallsQuote(contractCallsQuoteRequest);
```

## Contract call Quote request parameters

The `getContractCallsQuote` function expects a `ContractCallsQuoteRequest` object, which includes all the information needed to request a quote for a destination contract call.

Contract call quote request can be treated as an extension to the quote request and in addition to the parameters mentioned below, all parameters listed in the [Other Quote parameters](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes#other-quote-parameters) section (such as `integrator`, `fee`, `slippage`, etc.) are also available when using `getContractCallsQuote`.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- |
|           |      |          |             |

Array of contract call objects.

| Parameter              | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fromAmount`           | string | yes      | The amount of tokens to be sent to the contract. This amount is independent of any previously bridged or deposited tokens. |
| `fromTokenAddress`     | string | yes      | The address of the token to be sent to the contract. For example, an ETH staking transaction would require ETH.            |
| `toContractAddress`    | string | yes      | The address of the contract to interact with on the destination chain.                                                     |
| `toContractCallData`   | string | yes      | The call data to be sent to the contract for the interaction on the destination chain.                                     |
| `toContractGasLimit`   | string | yes      | The estimated gas required for the contract call. Incorrect values may cause the interaction to fail.                      |
| `toApprovalAddress`    | string | no       | The address to approve the token transfer if it is different from the contract address.                                    |
| `contractOutputsToken` | string | no       | The address of the token that will be output by the contract, if applicable (e.g., staking ETH produces stETH).            |

## Difference between `Route` and `Quote`

Even though `Route` and `Quote` terms lie in the same field of providing you with the best option to make a swap or bridging transfer, there are some differences you need to be aware of.

A `Route` in LI.FI represents a detailed transfer plan that may include *multiple steps*. Each step corresponds to an individual transaction, such as swapping tokens or bridging funds between chains. These steps must be executed in a specific sequence, as each one depends on the output of the previous step. A `Route` provides a detailed pathway for complex transfers involving multiple actions.

In contrast, a `Quote` is a *single-step* transaction. It contains all the necessary information to perform a transfer in one go, without requiring any additional steps. `Quotes` are used for simpler transactions where a single action, such as a token swap or a cross-chain transfer, is sufficient. Thus, while `Routes` can involve multiple steps to complete a transfer, a `Quote` always represents just one step.

# Execute Routes/Quotes

> We allow you to execute any on-chain or cross-chain swap and bridging transfer and a combination of both.

The LI.FI SDK offers functionality to execute routes and quotes. In this guide, you'll learn how to utilize the SDK's features to handle complex cross-chain transfers, manage execution settings, and control the transaction flow.

## Execute route

Let's say you have obtained the route. Refer to [Request Routes/Quotes](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/request-routes-quotes) for more details.

Please make sure you've configured SDK with EVM/Solana providers. Refer to [Configure SDK Providers](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/configure-sdk-providers) for more details.

Now, to execute the route, we can use the `executeRoute` function. Here is a simplified example of how to use it:

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { executeRoute, getRoutes } from '@lifi/sdk'

const result = await getRoutes({
  fromChainId: 42161, // Arbitrum
  toChainId: 10, // Optimism
  fromTokenAddress: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on Arbitrum
  toTokenAddress: '0xDA10009cBd5D07dd0CeCc66161FC93D7c9000da1', // DAI on Optimism
  fromAmount: '10000000', // 10 USDC
  // The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
  fromAddress: '0x552008c0f6870c2f77e5cC1d2eb9bdff03e30Ea0', 
})

const route = result.routes[0]

const executedRoute = await executeRoute(route, {
  // Gets called once the route object gets new updates
  updateRouteHook(route) {
    console.log(route)
  },
})
```

The `executeRoute` function internally manages allowance and balance checks, chain switching, transaction data retrieval, transactions submission, and transactions status tracking.

* **Parameters:**

  * `route` (`Route`): The route to be executed.

  * `executionOptions` (`ExecutionOptions`, optional): An object containing settings and callbacks for execution.
* **Returns:**

  * `Promise<RouteExtended>`: Resolves when execution is done or halted and rejects when it is failed.

### Execution Options

All execution options are optional, but we recommend reviewing their descriptions to determine which ones may be beneficial for your use case.

Certain options, such as [acceptExchangeRateUpdateHook](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/execute-routes-quotes#acceptexchangerateupdatehook), can be crucial for successfully completing a transfer if the exchange rate changes during the process.

#### `updateRouteHook`

The function is called when the route object changes during execution. This function allows you to handle route updates, track execution status, transaction hashes, etc. See [Monitor route execution](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/execute-routes-quotes#monitor-route-execution) section for more details.

* **Parameters**:

  * `updatedRoute` (`RouteExtended`): The updated route object.

#### `updateTransactionRequestHook`

The function is intended for advanced usage, and it allows you to modify swap/bridge transaction requests or token approval requests before they are sent, e.g., updating gas information.

* **Parameters**:

  * `updatedTxRequest` (`TransactionRequestParameters`): The transaction request parameters need to be updated.
* **Returns**: `Promise<TransactionParameters>`: The modified transaction parameters.

#### `acceptExchangeRateUpdateHook`

This function is called whenever the exchange rate changes during a swap or bridge operation. It provides you with the old and new amount values. To continue the execution, you should return `true`. If this hook is not provided or if you return `false`, the SDK will throw an error. This hook is an ideal place to prompt your users to accept the new exchange rate.

* **Parameters**:

  * `toToken` (`Token`): The destination token.

  * `oldToAmount` (`string`): The previous amount of the target token.

  * `newToAmount` (`string`): The new amount of the target token.

* **Returns**: `Promise<boolean | undefined>`: Whether the update is accepted.

* **Throws:** `TransactionError: Exchange rate has changed!`

#### `switchChainHook`

* **Parameters**:

  * `chainId` (`number`): The ID of the chain to which to switch.
* **Returns**: `Promise<WalletClient | undefined>`: The new wallet client after switching chains.

#### `executeInBackground`

A boolean flag indicating whether the route execution should continue in the background without requiring user interaction. See [Update route execution](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/execute-routes-quotes#update-route-execution) and [Resume route execution](https://docs.li.fi/integrate-li.fi-sdk/execute-routes-quotes#resume-route-execution) sections for details on how to utilize this option.

* **Type**: `boolean`

* **Default**: `false`

#### `disableMessageSigning`

A boolean flag indicating whether to disable message signing during execution. Certain operations require signing EIP-712 messages, including Permit approvals (ERC-2612) and gasless transactions. This functionality may not be compatible with all smart accounts or wallets, in which case this flag should be set to true to disable message signing.

* **Type**: `boolean`

* **Default**: `false`

## Manage route execution

After starting route execution, there might be use cases when you need to adjust execution settings, stop execution and come back later, or move execution to the background. We provide several functions to achieve that.

### Update route execution

The `updateRouteExecution` function is used to update the settings of an ongoing route execution.

One common use case is to push the execution to the background, for example, when a user navigates away from the execution page in your dApp. When this function is called, the execution will continue until it requires user interaction (e.g., signing a transaction or switching the chain). At that point, the execution will halt, and the `executeRoute` promise will be resolved.

To move the execution back to the foreground and make it active again, you can call `resumeRoute` with the same route object. The execution will then resume from where it was halted.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { updateRouteExecution } from '@lifi/sdk'

updateRouteExecution(route, { executeInBackground: true });
```

* **Parameters:**

  * `route` (`Route`): The active route to be updated.

  * `executionOptions` (`ExecutionOptions`, **required**): An object containing settings and callbacks for execution.

### Resume route execution

The `resumeRoute` function is used to resume a halted, aborted, or failed route execution from the point where it stopped. It is crucial to call `resumeRoute` with the latest active route object returned from the `executeRoute` function or the most recent version of the updated route object from the `updateRouteHook`.

#### Common Use Cases

* **Move Execution to Foreground**: When a user navigates back to the execution page in your dApp, you can call this function to move the execution back to the foreground. The execution will resume from where it was halted.

* **Page Refresh**: If the user refreshes the page in the middle of the execution process, calling this function will attempt to resume the execution.

* **User Interaction Errors**: If the user rejects a chain switch, declines to sign a transaction, or encounters any other error, you can call this function to attempt to resume the execution.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { resumeRoute } from '@lifi/sdk'

const route = await resumeRoute(route, { executeInBackground: false });
```

* **Parameters:**

  * `route` (`Route`): The route to be resumed to execution.

  * `executionOptions` (`ExecutionOptions`, optional): An object containing settings and callbacks for execution.
* **Returns:**

  * `Promise<RouteExtended>`: Resolves when execution is done or halted and rejects when it is failed.

### Stop route execution

The `stopRouteExecution` function is used to stop the ongoing execution of an active route. It stops any remaining user interaction within the ongoing execution and removes the route from the execution queue. However, if a transaction has already been signed and sent by the user, it will be executed on-chain.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { stopRouteExecution } from '@lifi/sdk'

const stoppedRoute = stopRouteExecution(route);
```

* **Parameters:**

  * `route` (`Route`): The route that is currently being executed and needs to be stopped.
* **Returns:**

  * `Route`: The route object that was stopped.

## Monitor route execution

Monitoring route execution is important and we provide tools for tracking progress, receiving data updates, accessing transaction hashes, and explorer links.

### Brief description of steps

A `route` object includes multiple `step` objects, each representing a set of transactions that should be completed in the specified order. Each step can include multiple transactions that require a signature, such as an allowance transaction followed by the main swap or bridge transaction. Read more [LI.FI Terminology](https://docs.li.fi/overview/li.fi-terminology).

### Understanding the `execution` object

Each `step` within a `route` has an `execution` object. This object contains all the necessary information to track the execution progress of that step. The `execution` object has a `process` array where each entry represents a sequential stage in the execution. The latest process entry contains the most recent information about the execution stage.

### Process array

The `process` array within the `execution` object details each step’s progression. Each `process` object has a type and status and might also include a transaction hash and a link to a blockchain explorer after the user signs the transaction.

### Tracking progress

To monitor the execution progress, you leverage the `updateRouteHook` callback and iterate through the route steps, checking their `execution` objects. Look at the `process` array to get the latest information about the execution stage. The most recent entry in the `process` array will contain the latest transaction hash, status, and other relevant details.

### Example to access transaction hashes

```typescript  theme={"system"}
const getTransactionLinks = (route: RouteExtended) => {
  route.steps.forEach((step, index) => {
    step.execution?.process.forEach((process) => {
      if (process.txHash) {
        console.log(
          `Transaction Hash for Step ${index + 1}, Process ${process.type}:`,
          process.txHash
        )
      }
    })
  })
}

const executedRoute = await executeRoute(route, {
  updateRouteHook(route) {
    getTransactionLinks(route)
  },
})
```

### Get active routes

To get routes that are currently being executed (active), you can use `getActiveRoutes` and `getActiveRoute` functions.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { getActiveRoute, getActiveRoutes, RouteExtended } from '@lifi/sdk'

const activeRoutes: RouteExtended[] = getActiveRoutes();

const routeId = activeRoutes[0].routeId;

const activeRoute = getActiveRoute(routeId);
```

## Execute quote

To execute a quote using the `executeRoute`, you need to convert it to a route object first. We provide `convertQuoteToRoute` helper function to transform quote objects to route objects. This applies to both standard and contract call quotes.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { convertQuoteToRoute, executeRoute, getQuote } from '@lifi/sdk';

const quoteRequest: QuoteRequest = {
  fromChain: 42161, // Arbitrum
  toChain: 10, // Optimism
  fromToken: '0xaf88d065e77c8cC2239327C5EDb3A432268e5831', // USDC on Arbitrum
  toToken: '0xDA10009cBd5D07dd0CeCc66161FC93D7c9000da1', // DAI on Optimism
  fromAmount: '10000000', // 10 USDC
  // The address from which the tokens are being transferred.
  fromAddress: '0x552008c0f6870c2f77e5cC1d2eb9bdff03e30Ea0', 
};

const quote = await getQuote(quoteRequest);

const route = convertQuoteToRoute(quote)

const executedRoute = await executeRoute(route, {
  // Gets called once the route object gets new updates
  updateRouteHook(route) {
    console.log(route)
  },
})
```

## Manual route execution

In addition to using the `executeRoute` function, you can execute routes and quotes manually. This approach requires developers to handle the logic for obtaining transaction data, switching chains, sending transactions, and tracking transaction status independently.

Initially, when route objects are requested, they do not include transaction data. This is because multiple route options are provided, and generating transaction data for all options would substantially delay the response. Each route consists of multiple steps, and once a user selects a route, transaction data for each step should be requested individually using the `getStepTransaction` function (see example below). Each step should be executed sequentially, as each step depends on the outcome of the previous one.

On the other hand, quote objects are returned with transaction data included, so the `getStepTransaction` call is not necessary, and they can be executed immediately.

After sending a transaction using the obtained transaction data, you can track the status of the transaction using the `getStatus` function. This function helps you monitor the progress and completion of each transaction. Read more [Status of a Transaction](https://docs.li.fi/li.fi-api/li.fi-api/status-of-a-transaction).

Here's a simplified example. For the sake of simplicity, this example omits balance checks, transaction replacements, error handling, chain switching, etc. However, in a real implementation, you should include these additional functionalities to have a robust solution and ensure reliability.

```typescript  theme={"system"}
import { getStepTransaction, getStatus } from '@lifi/sdk';

// Simplified example function to execute each step of the route sequentially
async function executeRouteSteps(route) {
  for (const step of route.steps) {
    // Request transaction data for the current step
    const step = await getStepTransaction(step);
    
    // Send the transaction (e.g. using Viem)
    const transactionHash = await sendTransaction(step.transactionRequest);
    
    // Monitor the status of the transaction
    let status;
    do {
      const result = await getStatus({
        txHash: transactionHash,
        fromChain: step.action.fromChainId,
        toChain: step.action.toChainId,
        bridge: step.tool,
      })
      status = result.status
      
      console.log(`Transaction status for ${transactionHash}:`, status);
      
      // Wait for a short period before checking the status again
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000));
      
    } while (status !== 'DONE' && status !== 'FAILED');
    
    if (status === 'FAILED') {
      console.error(`Transaction ${transactionHash} failed`);
      return;
    }
  }
  
  console.log('All steps executed successfully');
}
```

# Testing Integration

> Run test transactions on mainnets.

Testing your integration is a crucial step to ensure everything functions correctly before going live and we understand that.

We no longer support testnets and advise running your test transactions on mainnets. This is because bridges and exchanges have limited support for testnets and there is almost no liquidity on those networks.

Running test transactions on mainnets allows you to validate your setup in a real-world environment.

<Note>
  To minimize costs, we recommend testing on chains with low gas fees. Optimism and other Layer 2 (L2) chains are excellent choices for cost-effective testing.
